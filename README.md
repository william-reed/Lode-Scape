Lode Scape RPG
=============================================================

This is a small LIBGDX project I have been working on for the past couple of months. It combines ideas of many different RPG's. If you have any questions or comments contact me at wreed58@gmail.com

Check out [this thread on java-gaming.org](http://www.java-gaming.org/topics/lodescape-rpg/28679/msg/261599/view.html#msg261599) for lots of screenshots and some gameplay videos. I would not recommend looking at this code for any reference whatsoever. The screenshots and gameplay are still pretty neat tho so check those out!
